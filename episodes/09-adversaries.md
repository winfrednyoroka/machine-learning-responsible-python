## Manipulation of models

<!--  TODO:

Look at 4 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05345.pdf

It is important to be aware that models are susceptible to manipulation by targeted attacks. While the risk of attack is limited in most cases of model deployment, it is reasonable to assume that the risk will increase as the stakes increase.

## Data injection

<!--  TODO:

Where models are continuously trained, there is risk that new training data might be intentionally injected in order to achieve a desired outcome.

-->

## Adversarial attacks

<!--  TODO:

Data can be overlaid with targeted values that lead to misclassification.
