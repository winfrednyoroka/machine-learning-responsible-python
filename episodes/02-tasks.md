## Tackling the right tasks

Machine learning is a rapidly advancing, powerful technology that is helping to drive innovation. Before embarking on a machine learning project, consider the task carefully. Many machine learning efforts are not solving problems that need to be solved. Worse, many applications of machine learning are not for the public good. 

The [NIH Guiding Principles for Ethical Research](https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/guiding-principles-ethical-research) provide a good starting point for any project. A slightly modified version of these principles is outlined below:

- Social and clinical value: Does the social or clinical value of developing and implementing the model outweigh the risk and burden of the people involved?
- Scientific validity: Once created, will the model provide valid, meaningful outputs?
- Fair subject selection: Are the people who contribute and benefit from the model selected fairly, and not through vulnerability, privilege, or other unrelated factors?
- Favorable risk-benefit ratio: Do the potential benefits of of developing and implementing the model outweigh the risks?
- Independent review: Has the project been reviewed by someone independent of the project, and has an Institutional Review Board (IRB) been approached where appropriate? 
- Informed consent: Are participants whose data contributes to development and implementation of the model, as well as downstream recipients of the model, kept informed?
- Respect for potential and enrolled subjects: Is the privacy of participants respected and are steps taken to continuously monitor the effect of the model on downstream participants?

What kind of tasks should we be trying to tackle? How much should we worry about technology being misused several years down the line? The answers are not always clear. Here we explore some cases that have raised concerns relating to discrimination, misinformation, and privacy.

## Identifying genetic disorders from a photograph

In 2019, Nature Medicine [published a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0279-0.epdf) that described work to develop a model that could identify genetic disorders from a photograph of a patient's face. The abstract of the paper is copied below:

> Syndromic genetic conditions, in aggregate, affect 8% of the population1. Many syndromes have recognizable facial features that are highly informative to clinical geneticists3–5. Recent studies show that facial analysis technologies measured up to the capabilities of expert clinicians in syndrome identification. However, these technologies identified only a few disease phenotypes, limiting their role in clinical settings, where hundreds of diagnoses must be considered. Here we present a facial image analysis framework, DeepGestalt, using computer vision and deep-learning algorithms, that quantifies similarities to hundreds of syndromes. DeepGestalt outperformed clinicians in three initial experiments, two with the goal of distinguishing subjects with a target syndrome from other syndromes, and one of separating different genetic sub-types in Noonan syndrome. On the final experiment reflecting a real clinical setting problem, DeepGestalt achieved 91% top-10 accuracy in identifying the correct syndrome on 502 different images. The model was trained on a dataset of over 17,000 images representing more than 200 syndromes, curated through a community-driven phenotyping platform. DeepGestalt potentially adds considerable value to phenotypic evaluations in clinical genetics, genetic testing, research and precision medicine.

This technology underpins a phone app called Face2Gene, which is able to report on genetic conditions at the snap of a person's face. Media reports on the technology generally favourably, for example reporting on the [excitement of clinicians at this technology](https://www.genengnews.com/insights/a-i-gets-in-the-face-of-rare-genetic-diseases/):

> In a room full of clinical geneticists, he projected many faces of people who had been diagnosed with varying dysmorphic diseases and asked the physicians to assign a genetic disorder to each face. Suffice it to say, the physicians performed poorly—far worse than the computer...One of the most exciting aspects of the program ... is its ease. After asking just one question to a patient, “is it ok if I take a picture?” and snapping a quick photo, the program offers results back within seconds.
