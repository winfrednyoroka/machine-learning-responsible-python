## Responsible machine learning

Like many technologies, machine learning has the potential to cause harm is applied inappropriately. With machine learning, the issues can be subtle: a seemingly good model may in fact be anything but.

In this lesson we look broadly at a number of topics that are important for applying machine learning responsibly. These topics range from choosing appropriate tasks, to awareness of sources of bias, to following best practice on reporting results.
